# Stiffness model identification

The repository contains Maxima CAS files for modeling the reduced stiffness model of a manipulator. 
It allows to apply the experimental and algebraic approaches and compare the result. 
_main3.mac_ deals with a 3 link manipulator, _main6.mac_ - with 6 links, _elasto.mac_ is the required library.
